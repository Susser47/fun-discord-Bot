# how to setup this bot  
to set up this bot you first clone the repository doing  

```
git clone https://github.com/Susser47/Discord-Bot/  
```

command or by just copying the code off of github if you dont have git installed  
  
once you have the exact files you will need to create the BotToken.py file and inside should be this text:  
```
token = "your bot token" 
``` 

where "your bot token" is your actual bot token, then after this you can start the bot  

then you will have to change the server description in serverinfo.json so the serevrinfo command will work properly

## note  
if in the json file the jokes are repeted it's because they were written by chat gpt
